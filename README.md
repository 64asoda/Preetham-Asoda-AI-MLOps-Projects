## Projects

### Flagship Projects
- **[Retail Intelligence ML Platform](./Retail-Intelligence-Project)**  
  End-to-end ML platform orchestrated with Apache Airflow, PySpark, MLflow, and parallel model execution. Includes recommender systems, forecasting, and segmentation pipelines for large-scale retail data.

- **[Production RAG & LLMOps Platform](./Subtitle-RAG)**  
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation service using FastAPI, ChromaDB, Docker, and Kubernetes. Includes CI/CD pipelines, LangSmith observability, and modular architecture for scalable deployments.

- **[Bank Churn Prediction Pipeline](./MLOps-Bank-Churn-Project)**  
  End-to-end ML pipeline on GCP using XGBoost, Astro Airflow, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Flask API. Features automated data processing, model training, and real-time monitoring.
