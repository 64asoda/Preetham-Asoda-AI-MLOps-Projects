# Agentic AI Workflows

This folder contains projects demonstrating **Agentic AI systems** built using AutoGen and Google ADK. These workflows showcase autonomous multi-agent orchestration, collaborative agent patterns, and integration with enterprise systems.

---

## Projects & Workflows

### Google ADK Agents
- Implemented **Base Agent**, **Loop Agent**, **Web Agent**, and **Programmatic Agent** for simple, modular use cases.
- Designed agents with reusable templates to facilitate rapid deployment of additional workflows.

### Agentic AI Automation
- Developed a fully autonomous **user registration system** using Database, API, and Excel agents.
- Demonstrates end-to-end workflow execution without manual intervention.

### Collaborative Agent Workflows
- Built collaborative patterns including:
  - **RoundRobinGroupChat** – Agents communicate in a round-robin manner to complete tasks.
  - **SelectorGroupChat** – Agents coordinate task assignment dynamically.
  - **MultimodalWebSurfer** – Agents collect and process information from multiple sources autonomously.

### JIRA Integration System
- Designed specialized agents to automate **project management and ticket lifecycle**.
- Agents handle routine updates, status tracking, and notifications across JIRA projects.

### Agent Factory Design
- Configured **reusable, generic AI agents** with **configuration-driven context feeding**.
- Enables scalable deployment of agents across multiple workflows and domains.
